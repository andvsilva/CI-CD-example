## Introduction

- So far, we’ve discussed how to build simple web pages using HTML and CSS, and how to use Git and GitHub in order to keep track of changes to our code and collaborate with others. We also familiarized ourselves with the Python programming language, started using Django to create web applications, and learned how to use Django models to store information in our sites. We then introduced JavaScript and learned how to use it to make web pages more interactive, and talked about using animation and React to further improve our User Interfaces.
Today, we’ll learn about best practices when if comes to working on and launching larger projects.
